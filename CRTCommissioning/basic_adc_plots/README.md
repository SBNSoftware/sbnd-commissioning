#Basic ADC Distrubtion Plots

Directory for plots of pedestals and ADC distributions for triggered events. Can be run over small data samples to look for dead channels, odd behaviors etc. 

- Run `make` in directory for fresh checkout and after making any changes, before running scripts
- Bash scripts in `../bash_scripts`  will automatically run these in order when sourced.
